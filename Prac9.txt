Aim: Wireless Network threats (sniff wifi hotspots, analyze strength, and discover wireless 
access points).

1. Type http://inssider.en.softonic.com/download in the address bar of a web browser, and 
press enter, as shown in figure
2. In the webpage that opens, click on the link, download InSSIDer for windows, as shown in 
figure

4. Click on the downloaded files
5. In the next screen that appears, click on next
6. In the next screen, click on the ‘everyone’ radio button, and then click next
7. In the next screen that appears, click on next, as shown in figure

Then InSSDer icon will appear on the desktop
10. Double click on the InSSDer icon on the desktop,
Then the following screen will appear, as shown in figure below
11. Click on the Time Graph tab, as shown in figure
It will show the time graph of all the available SSID, we need to select the particular SSID
What we need to know
12. Click on the particular SSID as shown in figure 12, in this lab we have selected 
WSTREAM AP0 SSID
Now you have to select another SSID for comparison
13. Scroll down the SSID and select WStream AP -1
14. Click on the 2.4 GHz channels tab
16. it will show 2.4Ghz channels for two SSID, WStreamAP1 and WStreamAP0 
17. Click on 5Ghz channel(blank screen appears)
Thus, you can see the signal strength for both the SSIDs.
In this way, we can analyse wireless network strength with the help of SSIDer too1
