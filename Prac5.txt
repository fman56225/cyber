Practical on Wireless and Bluetooth attacks.

 Log in to kali Linux and launch the command terminal

First, check if the wireless card is connected or not by using the "iwconfig" command

iwconfig

Change the wireless interface inti monitor mode using "airmon-ng start wlan0" command 
with wlan0 as your wireless interface name

airmon-ng start wlan0

 use "airodump" to find out the SSID on the interface using the command: 

 "airodump-ng -write capture wlan0"

Use the following command to capture a 4-way handshake by using airmon-ng to monitor 
traffic on the target network using the channel and BSSID values

"airodump-ng -c 3--bssid 9C:5C:XX:XX:XX:XX -w.wlan0"

Now, wait to capture the handshake packet. Once you have capture a packet, you will see 
the output similar to figure

 You will see a capture .cap file in your /root location which is a default location

Now, run this capture file against a wordlist to crack the WPA key
