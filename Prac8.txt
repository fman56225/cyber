Aim: Practical on injecting Code in Data Driven Applications: SQL Injection.

1. Log in to Kali Linux
2. Open a web browser and enter the URL of the website you want to exploit, as shown in 
figure
If a URL, for example http://testphp.vulnweb.com/listproducts.php?cat=1, has a GET 
parameter as cat=1, then it is vulnerable to SQL injection attack
3. You check is your website is vulnerable by replacing the value=1 with * in GET
parameter. If the website result in an error as shown in figure, then it is vulnerable
If a URL, for example http://testphp.vulnweb.com/listproducts.php?cat=1, has a GET 
parameter as cat=1, then it is vulnerable to SQL injection attack
3. You check is your website is vulnerable by replacing the value=1 with * in GET
parameter. If the website result in an error as shown in figure, then it is vulnerable
4. Open Terminal in Kali Linux
5. Type sqlmap-h and press enter to view the help and list of parameter passed in the 
SQLMAP
6. Type the following command and press enter to list the information about the existing 
databases, as sown in figure 5a, figure 5b and figure 5c
 "sqlmap -u http://testphp.vulnweb.com/listproducts.php?cat=1 --dbs"
Enter N when SQLMAP ask to skip payload for other databases except from the detected 
databases.
Enter N again when SQLMAP ask to include all test
In output part3, you can see the executed payloads, available databases and backend database 
version
7. Type the following command and press enter to list information about tables present in a 
particular database, as shown in figure
 sqlmap-u http://testphp.vulnweb.com/listproducts.php?cat=1 -D acuart --tables
Figure 6a and 6b displays the output
In figure 6b you can see that there are eight tables.
8. Type the following command and press enter to list information about the column
of a particular table, as shown in figure 7a
"sqlmap -u http://testphp.vulnweb.com/listproducts.php?cat=1 -D acuart -T artists -columns"
figure 7a and 7b displays the output
9. Type the following command and press enter to dump the data from the column,
as shown in figure 8a
 "sqlmap -u http://testphp.vulnweb.com/listproducts.php?cat=1 -D acuart -T artists -C aname --
dump"
figure 8a and 8b displays the output
